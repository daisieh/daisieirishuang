## Academic Experience

<div id=highlight><div id=title>Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Cronk Lab, University of British Columbia, 6/2012 to
present.</div></div>
Working on the POPCAN project funded by Genome Canada to
explore genomic and phenotypic variability in poplar. Under the
supervision of Dr. Quentin Cronk, I am investigating phylogenetic
relationships in the genus _Populus_ and its relatives in the Salicaceae
by using whole plastome and chondrome data, with eventual scaling to
multilocus nuclear genes in a coalescent framework. Additionally, I am
developing software pipelines for efficient targeted assembly of
next-generation sequencing libraries and involved in several
collaborative open-source software projects.

<div id=highlight><div id=title>Postdoctoral Researcher, Hodges Lab, University of California at Santa Barbara.
10/2010 to 5/2012.</div></div>
Worked with Dr. Scott Hodges in conducting population
genetics and genomic research in the genus _Aquilegia_ (Ranunculaceae).
Used next-generation sequencing data, investigating functional
differences in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in order to
understand how flower color affects species differentiation and
adaptation. Implemented the VIGS transformation protocol developed at
Dr. Elena Kramer's lab for knockdown expression of genes in _Aquilegia._
Created mRNA-seq libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing.
Genotyped individuals from a large pollen-competition study involving
over 1000 genetic individuals and analyzed the resulting dataset.
Developed a method for extracting genomic DNA from inviable _Aquilegia_
seeds, allowing genetic data to be obtained from materials previously
thought to be unusable.

<div id=title>Teaching Assistant, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, Claremont, CA,
1/2008 to 5/2008.</div>
Assisted Dr. Elizabeth A. Friar in teaching Advanced
Population Genetics. Assigned and graded weekly problem sets. Assisted
Dr. Friar in designing and grading midterm and final exams. Assisted Dr.
Friar in preparing lectures. Conducted weekly discussion sessions and
office hours. Maintained a web site for the class.

<div id=title>Molecular Systematics Research Assistant, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic
Garden, Claremont, CA, 1/2006 to 8/2008.</div>
Performed molecular analyses for Dr. Jennifer Cruse-Sanders and Dr. Elizabeth A. Friar's research (NSF Award Number 0519546). Developed silica-based method of extracting genomic DNA from polysaccharide-rich plant tissue. Extracted DNA from preserved
samples of _Stenocereus stellatus_. Amplified and scored microsatellite
markers for _S. stellatus_ samples. Amplified and sequenced data from
chloroplast markers in _S. stellatus._

<div id=title>Herbarium Research Assistant, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden,
Claremont, CA, 8/2005 to 12/2005.</div>
Assisted with reidentifications of
RSA-POM specimens for Dr. John Kartesz's Biota of North America.
Mounted, filed, and databased specimens. Wrote scripts to update 4000+
recalcitrant entries in the herbarium's main Filemaker Pro database.
